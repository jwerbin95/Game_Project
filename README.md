# Really Annoying Tetris


<p>The classic tetris game, but when you move the blocks to the left and right, the block <strong><em>changes shape randomly.</em></strong> There will be <strong><em>multiple blocks on the screen</em></strong> at once, staggered by a few seconds. When you clear a line, it will clear the whole line... <strong><em>Except for one block.</em></strong> </p>

<p>You want lives?</p>
<h6>TOO BAD!</h6>

<p>You want to see what block comes next?</p>
<h6>TOO BAD!</h6>

<p>If you feel like frustrating youself, play this game.</p>
